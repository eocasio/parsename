# parsename
Python class to parse common long names used in Puerto Rico.

This class is a quick solution to parse most of the long composed names I have encountered in my data wrangling adventures.  It is not a full name parser, like [python-nameparser](https://github.com/derek73/python-nameparser), which I highly recommend for handling English names.
